# Frontend for Golf Ball Tracking Web Application

This directory contains the frontend for the golf ball tracking web application, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays real-time golf ball data received from the backend over WebSockets.

## Overview

The frontend consists of a single HTML page (`index.html`) that displays the velocity and state of the golf ball. It uses JavaScript (`script.js`) to handle WebSocket connections and update the UI in real-time.

## Local Development

To run the frontend locally, you'll need to start the backend server first (see the `backend/README.md` for instructions). Once the backend is running, open `index.html` in your browser to view the application.
